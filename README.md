# Terraform Single VM Deployment

This branch contains Terraform configurations for deploying a single virtual machine (VM) in a cloud environment. It demonstrates how to provision a VM using best practices in infrastructure as code (IaC) with Terraform.

## Project Overview

The **Single-vm** branch is designed to showcase a straightforward setup for deploying a single VM on your chosen cloud provider. This example includes all necessary configurations and best practices to ensure a smooth deployment.

## File Structure

The branch contains the following files:

- **`main.tf`**: The main Terraform configuration file for provisioning the VM.
- **`variables.tf`**: Defines the input variables for customization.
- **`terraform.tfvars`**: Contains the variable values for the deployment.
- **`outputs.tf`**: Specifies the outputs for the deployed resources.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the branch.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your machine.
- An active account with the cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Cloud CLI installed for authentication (optional but recommended).

### Configuration

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sanidhya-Vats/Terraform.git
   cd Terraform
   git checkout Single-vm
   ```

2. **Customize the variables**:
   Open `terraform.tfvars` and modify the variables according to your requirements, such as the VM size, region, and image.

### Deploying the VM

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Plan the deployment**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Apply the configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the action when prompted.

### Cleaning Up

To remove the resources created by Terraform, run:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
